# )Write a program that prompts the user to input a year and determine whether the
# year is a leap year or not. Leap Years are any year that can be evenly divided by 4.
# A year that is evenly divisible by 100 is a leap year only if it is also evenly divisible by
# 400.
# Example :
# 1992 Leap Year
# 2000 Leap Year
# 1900 NOT a Leap Year
# 1995 NOT a Leap Year


# stpe 1 take input form the user in the year fromate
# step 2 write a logic for the leap year that is if the given year ex 1998%4 == 0 then it is leap year
